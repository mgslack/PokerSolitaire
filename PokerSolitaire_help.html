      <p>Poker solitaire is a simple game in which a player will get dealt 25 cards to place in a 5 x 5 play area
	     in which to get the best poker hands horizontally, diagonally and vertically.  Need to lay out cards to
		 get poker hands from a pair up to a royal straight flush.</p>
	  <p>Standard poker hands are scored as they are completed in the play area (have 5 in a row, column or diagonal)
	     with the scoring using the American scoring rules. Score is based on the strength of the poker hand,
		 where more points are given for the better hand.  The scoring is as follows:<br>
		 <table>
		   <thead>
		     <tr>
			   <th>Points</th>
			   <th>Hand</th>
			 </tr>
		   </thead>
		   <tbody>
		     <tr>
			   <td>100</td>
			   <td>Royal Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>75</td>
			   <td>Straight Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>50</td>
			   <td>Four of a Kind</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>25</td>
			   <td>Full House</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>20</td>
			   <td>Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>15</td>
			   <td>Straight</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>10</td>
			   <td>Three of a Kind</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>5</td>
			   <td>Two Pair</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>2</td>
			   <td>One Pair</td>
			 </tr>
		   </tbody>
		 </table>
	  </p>
	  <p>Once the new game button is pressed, the first card is dealt to the player.  Place the card in one of the
	     25 spots, and once placed, the next card is dealt.  The play continues till all 25 cards have been dealt
		 and placed in one of the slots.</p>
	  <p>The game is considered 'won', if the score of all of the hands is greater or equal to the winning
	     score, which defaults to 150 points for this game.  Normal poker solitaire winning score is usually
		 200 points, that can be changed to if wanted - or made easier (lower) if so chosen.</p>
	  <p>There is a built in 'hint' routine, but is fairly simplistic and an option to have the computer
	     auto-play out the game.  Note, if auto-played, the high score is not tracked.  At this time,
		 the auto-play basically plays out by getting a hint and playing the spot the hint routine
		 selects.</p>
	  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Options:</div>
	  <p>There a couple of options that can be set for the Poker Solitaire game.  To set, select options
         from the context menu (right click).  The first option sets the card back image used for the card
		 deck in the main form.  The other option allows setting the winning score value (easy = 100 points,
		 normal = 150 points and hard = 200 points).  In addition, the window location is saved when the
		 game is exited.</p>
