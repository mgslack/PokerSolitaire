      <p>Poker solitaire is a simple game in which a player will get dealt 25 cards to place in a 5 x 5 play area
	     in which to get the best poker hands horizontally, diagonally and vertically.  Need to lay out cards to
		 get poker hands from a pair up to a royal straight flush.</p>
	  <p>Standard poker hands are scored as they are completed in the play area (have 5 in a row, column or diagonal)
	     with the scoring using the American scoring rules. Score is based on the strength of the poker hand,
		 where more points are given for the better hand.  The scoring is as follows:<br>
		 <table>
		   <thead>
		     <tr>
			   <th>Points</th>
			   <th>Hand</th>
			 </tr>
		   </thead>
		   <tbody>
		     <tr>
			   <td>100</td>
			   <td>Royal Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>75</td>
			   <td>Straight Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>50</td>
			   <td>Four of a Kind</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>25</td>
			   <td>Full House</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>20</td>
			   <td>Flush</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>15</td>
			   <td>Straight</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>10</td>
			   <td>Three of a Kind</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>5</td>
			   <td>Two Pair</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
			   <td>2</td>
			   <td>One Pair</td>
			 </tr>
		   </tbody>
		 </table>
	  </p>
	  <p>Once the new game button is pressed, the first card is dealt to the player.  Place the card in one of the
	     25 spots, and once placed, the next card is dealt.  The play continues till all 25 cards have been dealt
		 and placed in one of the slots.</p>
	  <p>There is a built in 'hint' routine, but is fairly simplistic and an option to have the computer
	     auto-play out the game.  Note, if auto-played, the high score is not tracked.  At this time,
		 the auto-play basically plays out by getting a hint and playing the spot the hint routine
		 selects.</p>
	  <div style="font-weight:bold;">Options:</div>
	  <p>There is only one option that can be set for the Poker Solitaire game.  It is the card back image
	     used for the card deck.  Select options from the context menu (right click).  In addition, the
		 window location is saved when the game is exited.</p>
